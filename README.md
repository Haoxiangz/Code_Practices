# Code_Practices

Processing projects that I did with tutorials from CodingTrain, might twist or add a few things here and there.

## Convex Hull

Given a set of points, find the set of points so that the convex hull they form includes every dots inside. 

There are runnable versions folders for this. In ConvexHull folder is the simple convex hull visualization, implemented with divide and conquer algorithm. ConvexHull_Brute version shows the intermediate steps in calculating the hull, implemented with bruteforce algorithm.  ConvexHull_Steps shows the steps implemented with divide and conquer algorithm. Each grey line represents one iteration of calculating whether this line is part of the hull, and blue line represents that this line is confirmed to be part of the hull (or temporarily). On the top left shows the number of dots and how many times the orientation function is called. 

## Circle Packing

Generate a set of circles that resemble a given image.
